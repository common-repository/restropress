RestroPress is a Food Ordering System for WordPress which will help the restaurant owners to sell their food online.
== Description ==
RestroPress is an Online Food Ordering system for WordPress. It is a standalone WordPress plugin which allows you to easily add a Food Ordering System to your WordPress Website. Using RestroPress you can easily receive both PickUp/Takeaway and Delivery orders.
RestroPress has a user-friendly frontend and backend interface which will allow you to easily manage the orders and also comes with a pre-built user dashboard to manage their profile and orders.
The plugin automatically adds the required pages to your site when you activate the plugin. The plugin outputs the food items on your page using [fooditems] shortcode.
= Shortcode Attributes =
* category (category ids or slug separated by comma(,))
* category_menu (this will show only the child category of the specified category)
* cat_orderby (Ordering for category)
* fooditem_orderby (ordering of food items inside the category)
* cat_order: asc/desc
* fooditem_order: asc/desc
**Examples**
[fooditems category="starter,snacks,lunch"]
The above shortcode should display the category sidebar with those 3 categories and the products would only be displayed from those 3 categories.
[fooditems category_menu="lunch"]
The above shortcode will only display the child categories of lunch on the category sidebar and also display the food items from the child category of lunch.
***Required ShortCodes***
1. [fooditems] -> By using [fooditems] shortcode you can show all your products on a single page.
2. [fooditem_checkout] -> This shortcode is used for the checkout page.
3. [rpress_receipt] -> This shortcode is used for the order confirmation page.
4. [order_history] -> This shortcode is used to show order history for the particular customer.
5. [rpress_login] -> This shortcode is used for customer login.
6. [rpress_register] -> This shortcode is used for customer registration.
7. [customer_dashboard] -> The shortcode provided is designated for the user dashboard, facilitating profile management and access to order history and status details. (Available from Version 3.1)
